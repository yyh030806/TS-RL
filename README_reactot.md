# React-OT: Optimal Transport for Generating Transition State in Chemical Reactions

In this work, we developed React-OT, an optimal transport approach to generate TSs of an elementary reaction in a fully deterministic manner. It is based on our previously developed diffusion-based generative model for generating 3D chemical reactions, [OA-ReactDiff](https://github.com/chenruduan/OAReactDiff). React-OT has been improved for generating transition state (TS) structures for a given reactants and products (double-ended search problem), enabling it to generate highly accurate transition state structures while maintaining an extremely high inference speed.

Learning the joint distribution of structures in elementary reactions (reactant in red, TS in yellow, and product in blue). b. Stochastic inference with inpainting in OA-ReactDiff. c.

We trained React-OT on Transition1x, a dataset that contains paired reactants, TSs, and products calculated from climbing-image NEB obtained with DFT (ωB97x/6-31G(d)). In React-OT, the object-aware version of LEFTNet is used as the scoring network to fit the transition kernel (see [LEFTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04757)). React-OT achieves a mean RMSD of 0.103 Å between generated and true TS structures on the set-aside test reactions of Transition1x, significantly improved upon previous state-of-the-art TS prediction methods.

Cumulative probability for structure root mean square deviation (RMSD) (left) and absolute energy error (|∆E TS|) (right) between the true and generated TS on 1,073 set-aside test reactions.  b. Reference TS structure, OA-ReactDiff TS sample (red), and React-OT structure (orange) for select reactions. c. Histogram (gray, left y axis) and cumulative probability(blue, right y axis) showing the difference of RMSD (left) and |∆ETS|(right) between OA-ReactDiff recommended and React-OT structures compared to reference TS. d. Inference time in seconds for single-shot OA-ReactDiff, 40-shot OA-ReactDiff with recommender, and React-OT.

We envision that the remarkable accuracy and rapid inference of React-OT will be highly useful when integrated with the current high-throughput TS search workflow. This integration will facilitate the exploration of chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.
